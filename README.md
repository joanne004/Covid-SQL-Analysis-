# COVID-19 Data Exploration and Tableau Dashboard
## Overview
This project involves data exploration and analysis of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data from the year 2020 to 2021. The dataset was meticulously examined using SQL queries to derive insights and trends related to the pandemic's impact on mortality rates and vaccination progress. Subsequently, a Tableau dashboard was developed to visualize the findings and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data.
## Data Source
The dataset used for this project comprises records of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination statistics spanning from 2020 to 2021. 
## SQL Data Exploration
The SQL data exploration phase involved querying and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights. Various SQL queries were crafted to aggregate, filter, and manipulate the data, uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations pertaining to COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates over time and across different demographics.
## Tableau Dashboard Development
Following the data exploration phase, the insights gleaned from SQL analysis were visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard([The Link to the Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19Dashboard_17106231072590/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)). The dashboard presents a user-friendly interface featuring intuitive visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to effectively communicate the key findings and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
